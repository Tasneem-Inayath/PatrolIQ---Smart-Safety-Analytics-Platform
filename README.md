# 🚓 PatrolIQ — Smart Safety Analytics Platform

AI-powered Crime Intelligence System for Urban Safety & Patrol Optimization

---

## 📌 Overview

**PatrolIQ** is an intelligent crime analytics platform built to help law enforcement agencies understand:

✔ **Where** crimes happen
✔ **When** crimes peak
✔ **What types** of crimes occur
✔ **How to deploy patrol units efficiently**

Using **MLflow-tracked models, unsupervised clustering, temporal analysis, dimensionality reduction visualizations, and interactive geospatial maps**, PatrolIQ transforms raw crime records into **actionable insights** for decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Key Goals

* Identify **high-risk crime zones**
* Detect **time-based crime patterns**
* Predict **patrol demand** based on clustering analysis
* Visualize crime severity using **PCA & UMAP embeddings**
* Provide an AI-assisted dashboard for **policing strategy and public safety**
